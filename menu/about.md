Hi, My name is **Mohamed El Shorbagy**, but you can call me rezk. Currently, I am a senior student at **Ain Shams University, Egypt**, studying **Computer and Systems Engineering**. My interests span various fields within the arena of **systems programming**, including:
- Compilers
- Virtual machines and Runtimes
- Dynamically-typed programming languages
- Programming languages implementation techniques

Additionally, I am interested in **graphics** and **computational geometry**.

I code in **Rust**, **Python**, **Lua**, **Bash**, and **C++**.

I use [**Void Linux**](https://voidlinux.org/) with [**i3wm**](https://i3wm.org/), you can take a look at my [**dotfiles**](https://github.com/elshorbagyx/dotfiles/).
